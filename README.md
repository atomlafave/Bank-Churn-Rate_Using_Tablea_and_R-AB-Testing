This document covers a case study to try and identify why customer's were leaving a bank(churn rate) at a faster rate than they were in the past. The example is done using AB and categorical testing in Tableau. I chose to use an R Studio Notebook to to make sure the data is clean before visualization and analysis. I also wanted to  show the cleaning steps used before importing my images created on Tableau Public. For simplicities sake I did not write out every step used in Tableau or this would be 100 pages long. Of course the entire analysis could be done in R, but it's meant to showcase the use of Tableau's great visualizations in a document shareable to my portfolio here on github.
