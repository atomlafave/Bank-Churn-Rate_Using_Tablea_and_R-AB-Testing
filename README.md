This document covers a case study to try and identify why customer's were leaving a bank(churn rate) at a faster rate than they were in the past. The example is done using the visualizations and AB Testing in Tableau. The aim of this document is to show my understanding of Tableau and how it can be used to not only make great visualizations, but also to mine data through modeling. I chose to use an R Studio Notebook to create the document so to make sure the data is clean, view previews of the data in raw form, and present the steps used in Tableau while modeling. Of course the entire analysis could be done in R, but it's meant to showcase the use of Tableau.
