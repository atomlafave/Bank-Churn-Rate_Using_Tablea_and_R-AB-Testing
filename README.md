This document involves a case study to help bank executives identify trends as to why customer's were leaving a bank(churn rate) at a faster rate than they have been in the past. I chose to use an R Studio to organize and clean the data before visualization and analysis. For simplicities sake I did not write out every step used in Tableau and the images are screenshots of the visualization after doing the Tableau inputs. Of course the entire analysis could be done in R, but it's meant to showcase the use of Tableau's great visualization tools.
